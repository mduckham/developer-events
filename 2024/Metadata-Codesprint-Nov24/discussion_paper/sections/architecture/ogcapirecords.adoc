==== OGC API - Records

The https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records[OGC API - Records] candidate Standard provides discovery and access to metadata records that describe resources such as features, coverages, tiles / maps, models, assets, datasets, services, or widgets (<<bib_ogcapirecords>>). The candidate Standard enables the discovery of geospatial resources by standardizing the way collections of descriptive information about the resources (metadata) are exposed. The candidate Standard also enables the discovery and sharing of related resources that may be referenced from geospatial resources or their metadata by standardizing the way all kinds of records are exposed and managed.
